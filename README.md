I am a person that tries their best to play their part for a better tomorrow, one commit at a time. If you wish to support my endeavours, consider supporting my efforts with a donation via [LiberaPay](https://liberapay.com/n0toose).

My activity on free and open-source software mostly takes place outside of GitHub. Many personal projects that I actively work on can be found on my [Codeberg profile](https://codeberg.org/n0toose).
