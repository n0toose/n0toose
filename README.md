This account is used for contributing to projects hosted on [github.com](https://github.com). **You can find my personal projects on [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/n0toose)**, which is one of the non-profit, libre, open-source alternatives to [github.com](https://github.com). However, I won't tell you to use any weird alternative like that: It is my belief that we should all be able to choose the tools that we love the most.

On an unrelated note, I gave a talk titled ["I beg you, please make your own GitHub alternatives!"](https://media.ccc.de/v/gpn22-492-i-beg-you-please-make-your-own-github-alternatives-) a while ago.

It is 59 minutes long. Because of it, I got called a "Greek Darth Vader" by a friend of mine and I am frankly *still* not over it.
